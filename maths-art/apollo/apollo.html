                    <h4>What are Apollonian Gaskets?</h4>
                    <p> An Apollonian Gasket is a circular fractal generated from a triad of "kissing" circles (a pair of circles are kissing if they are tangential in exactly one place; a triad of circles are kissing if each circle is once tangential to each other circle in the triad). An Apollonian Gasket is formed by iteratively constructing more kissing circles. (Try adjusting the "iterations" slider on the right!)</p>
                    <h4>Are there always more kissing circles?</h4>
                    <p>Yes! This was proven by Descartes in his famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes%27_theorem">theorem</a>. This also defines a quadratic equation linking the curvatures of the four circles, so given three it is possible to find the fourth.</p>
                    <h4>What about the positions of these circles?</h4>
                    <p>In 2001, a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0101066v1.pdf">paper</a> was published showing the relationship between Descartes' Theorem and complex numbers. The paper goes on to prove similar relationships between spheres and even generalises to n dimensions, but for our purposes we need only the 2D case. It is proven that Descartes' Theorem holds not only for curvatures, but also for circle centres (as a complex number) multiplied by their curvatures. Therefore, using both the original Descartes' Theorem and the complex extension, we can calculate the centres.</p>
                    <h4>I'm getting some graphical glitches when adjusting the sliders.</h4>
                    <p>Yeah, I've made some shortcuts in both the math and in coding to make it run quick enough to update in real-time on most browsers. Some of the glitches are related to this, some I'm not actually sure of; there seems to be some issue with points very close to the origin I can't seem to decipher. Do let me know if you can figure it out!</p>
