                            Over the winter break of 2020 I undertook a two-part project looking into the spread of a pandemic through a population. The first part of the project involved simulating the spread of a pandemic with tunable parameters through a population split into household bubbles. Such parameters included the probability of infecting both another person in the same bubble as well as in a different one, the average number of days taken to recover, and the average household bubble size. By fitting the infectivity and recovery parameters with what we know about COVID-19, for example, it is possible to determine the bubble size required to reduce the R-value to under 1.
                            <br><br>
                            The second part of the project involved using real-world data to model the effectiveness of government measures across the world. 
                            The dataset used was obtained from researchers from the John Hopkins University, and contained the number of new infections and recoveries each day. I looked at how different measures, such as the introduction of mandatory face masks and local and national lockdowns affected the R-value by plotting a phase-space diagram and showing the change in R over time. You can preview some of the results <a href="./projects/pandemic.html">here</a>.

                            As part of an introduction to NLP, I worked on a project relating to multiple different methods of sentiment analysis to determine which is the most accurate. This began with a simple lexical map of certain keywords which indicate sentiment directly ('good', 'bad', 'enjoyed', 'hated', etc.) which were used to calculate a sentiment score, but I quickly discovered this was a flawed method as the reviewer could be describing a small section of the movie, or use inverting phrases such as 'not bad', which flip the sentiment. I also needed to consider the strength of the words used ('bad' versus 'awful' for example), and the fact that this sentiment map had to be hand-made; it became apparent that a sentiment map was a poor choice and moving to machine learning was a better approach.
                            <br><br>
                            As such, I developed a training routine to perform the creation of a similar lexical map. By assuming feature independence it is possible to create a naïve Bayes classifier, which uses a set of training data to build a lexical map as before (but only requires the sentiment of each <i>review</i>, rather than each word -- this can even be done using the author's "star rating" that is usually given alongside a review, rather than manually assigned). The sentiment of a given review is then the max over each sentiment of the product of the probabilities of each word appearing in a review of that sentiment (argmax_s ∏_i s[word_i]) (in practice, I logged each probability to prevent underflow and gave words new to the classifier a small baseline probability of appearing to prevent the system giving 0 probability).
